    <h1>Taylor Reptile Funhouse</h1>

    <p>Our journey into reptiles didn't start very long ago! In fact, my kids found our first re-homing leopard gecko on
        KSL less a year ago in June, 2023. Since then we discovered our absolute love of reptiles and purchased a corn snake at a local reptile expo and found a bearded dragon as
        well as a tegu needing to be re-homed on KSL.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>Coconut is our leopard gecko. She is about 2 years old and is the only female reptile we will ever own because we
        discovered that they can become egg bound which can be a life threatening situation for any reptile. She is
        nocturnal so we mostly hang out with her early in the morning or later in the evening.<br>Pumpkin is our corn
        snake. He is about 4 years old and was an embassador snake for the company Morph Market. We joke that he chose
        us because he became so still and calm when interacting with my kids.<br>Nugget is our beared dragon and is also
        about 4 years old. He is like a reptilian puppy dog and actually likes interacting with my Australian Shepherds!
        He is easily the most social reptile I have ever known and will boop and scratch at his terrarium walls asking
        to be let out in order to be with us! It's adorable!<br>Mochi is an Argentine Tegu and our newest reptile. He's
        not quite 2 years old. He is a rescue and we're still learning a lot about him and his proper care. He is quite
        docile and will hand feed. He actually loves snuggling with my kids in their beds!</p>
